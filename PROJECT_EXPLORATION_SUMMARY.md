## Key Findings

### Project Strengths ✅
1. **Clean Architecture** - Well-separated concerns, modular design
2. **Modern Python** - Type hints, Pydantic validation, 3.13+ features
3. **Provider Abstraction** - Easy to add new LLM backends
4. **Test Coverage** - Good coverage for core features
5. **XDG Compliance** - Follows Linux filesystem standards

### Critical Issues 🚨
1. **Session Loading** - `_load_history()` function is called but not implemented
2. **Signature Mismatch** - `_save_history()` doesn't accept `session_id` parameter
3. **Diff Parsing** - Naive line-based approach, needs proper unified diff support

### Technical Debt 📊
- Incomplete session persistence (Milestone 4)
- Unused dependencies (gradio, potentially PyQt6)
- Smolagents imported but not integrated
- Large config spec in comments without implementation
- MCP references in config without implementation

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Months 1-3) 🏗️
**Focus:** Fix bugs, complete roadmap, establish testing foundation

**Deliverables:**
- All 5 roadmap milestones passing
- Test coverage >80%
- Documentation complete
- CI/CD pipeline

**Rationale:** Must stabilize core before adding new features

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities (Months 4-6) 🤖
**Focus:** Direction 1 (Agents) + Direction 4 (Sessions)

**Deliverables:**
- Smolagents integration
- Tool ecosystem (code analysis, test generation)
- Complete session persistence
- Workflow definitions

**Rationale:** These provide maximum value and synergy. Agents enable autonomy, sessions enable learning from history.

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Months 7-9) 📚
**Focus:** Direction 2 (RAG Enhancement)

**Deliverables:**
- Vector database indexing
- Semantic code search
- Context-aware chat
- Incremental indexing

**Rationale:** RAG enhances agent capabilities and enables scaling to large codebases.

### Phase 4: Integration & UX (Months 10-12) 💎
**Focus:** Direction 3 (UI) or Direction 5 (MCP)

**Decision Point:** Choose based on target audience
- **Direction 3** if targeting developers wanting IDE-like experience
- **Direction 5** if targeting integration with existing tooling

**Rationale:** These are polish and ecosystem plays, best done after core capabilities are solid.
